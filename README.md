**MCQ Generator Machine Learning (NLP) Notebook Project**

---

### Overview:

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system capable of generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from a given text corpus. The system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the text and generate relevant MCQs automatically.

### Features:

- **Text Preprocessing**: The notebook includes text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization to prepare the text data for further analysis.

- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent the text data in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- **Question Generation**: Implements algorithms to automatically generate MCQs based on the processed text data. These algorithms may involve rule-based approaches, deep learning models, or a combination of both.


- **User Interface**: Optionally, a simple user interface can be developed to interact with the MCQ generation system, allowing users to input text data and receive generated MCQs in pdf file.

### Usage:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that the required Python libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc., are installed. You can install them using pip or conda.

2. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter notebook provided in this repository and run each cell sequentially. Make necessary adjustments to paths, parameters as needed.
